### Intro
**A lot of people are saying that climate change will affect the timing of runoff in California? Is that true? Let's find out!** 

*Epistemic status: Not by any means a rigorous scientific study. This was more about seeing if I could get any insight out of relatively simple data analysis using easily available data. And also to develop a workflow for future analyses using Rmarkdown, RPubs, plot.ly and github. Very open to suggestions for improvement.*

If you've been following western water on twitter, you may have seen that Udall and Overpeck's <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016WR019638/full">recent paper</a> on "hot drought" in the Colorado River basin has been getting a lot of press. I've seen Jonathan Overpeck speak at a couple of conferences now and his message boils down to "**It's the temperature, stupid.**" He divides droughts in to "precipitation-dominated droughts" and "temperature-dominated droughts". Precip-dominated drought is what we normally tend to think of -- a drought happens because there's not enough precipitation. Increasingly, though, intense drought is occuring even when precip is only a little below average. The reason is higher temperatures due to climate change. In the most recent drought, Colorado River flows decreased more than predicted by precipitation alone; temperature played an outsized role.

In California, climate scientists predict that warmer temperatures will have two effects on precipitation:

1. More winter precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, and will runoff into streams and reservoirs immediately rather than being stored in the snowpack
2. The snowpack that does accumulate will melt faster.

The combined result of these effects is that reservoirs will see more inflow earlier in the year. The risk of flooding from spillway damage or dam overtopping, like we've seen with Oroville recently, will be higher. And because reservoirs are usually kept at a lower level in the winter to leave room for flood control, water that could have been banked if received later in the year will be spilled (this water provides an important environmental benefit, e.g. as young salmon habitat in the Yolo Bypass, so I don't believe in calling it 'lost' or 'wasted', but it does reduce the potential deliveries to human water users downstream).

### Method
Lake Oroville seems like a good reservoir to start with, for obvious reasons. I began by downloading reservoir inflow data from <a href="http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/staSearch">DWR</a> and importing it into R for analysis. The data goes back as far as 1995, giving us about 20 years of flows to work with. Plotting the time series and zooming in on any particular year, we can see the general pattern of inflow: winter storms bring sharp spikes of runoff from December to April, then melting snowpack produces a broad pulse of flow that sustains the reservoir until mid-summer (click and drag horizontally to zoom in on a year):

.
```{r flow time series}
l <- plot_ly(oro, x=~date, y=~inflow, type="scatter", mode="lines", fill="tozeroy", line = list(width=1)) %>%
  layout(title="Lake Oroville inflows, 1995-2016",
         xaxis = list(title = 'Water year'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Reservoir inflow (AF)'))
l
```
.

The large storms from the 1997-98 El Nino, one of the most powerful in recorded history, are evident.

### Finding the peak inflow
How should we determine the 'peak' of reservoir inflow? For reservoirs that dam rivers, we can imagine the inflow curve for each water year as a skewed bell curve representing the river's base flow, onto which is superimposed transient peaks from the winter storms. At first thought we could just find the day with the maximum flow for each water year, but that would give the date of the largest storm rather than the true midpoint of the curve. A better approach is to find the date at which 50% of the inflow for that year has occured. One way to do this is to turn the inflow curves into *cumulative* inflow curves, rescale them all to 0--1, and then find the date that corresponds to 0.5, the midpoint of the curve.

In the charts that follow, I used the water year, which starts on October 1, rather than calendar year. Precipitation in California is highly seasonal, with most precip falling between November and April. It makes sense to start counting inflows at the beginning of the wet season rather than in the middle.

.
```{r cumflow plot}
l <- plot_ly(oro, x=~date, y=~cumflow, type="scatter", mode="lines", fill="tozeroy") %>%
  layout(title = "Cumulative Lake Oroville inflow",
         xaxis = list(title = 'Water year'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Cumulative reservoir inflow (AF)'))
l
```
.

Here we can see a lot of variability in the total inflow from year to year. Lake Oroville has a capacity of 3.5 MAF, but during the stormy winter months DWR limits it to 2.8 MAF to allow space for flood control. That restriction is loosened after April 1, allowing snowmelt to top off the reservoir. In wet years, Oroville receives much more inflow than its capacity has to spill into the Feather River. In dry years such as the 2011-16 drought, it receives much less.

Normalizing the curves gives:

```{r scaled cumflow plot}
l <- plot_ly(oro, x=~date, y=~cumdist, type="scatter", mode="lines", fill="tozeroy") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Water year'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Cumulative reservoir inflow (AF)'))
l
```
.

Now we can easily find the date where the cumulative flow reaches 0.5 for each water year. Since we're interested in the effect of temperature on this date, I downloaded some CIMIS data from the Buntingville station, which is not all that close to Oroville but is at least one of the few stations deep in the Sierra where the snow lives. Ideally we'd want to find some better data to get an average from different points around the Oroville watershed.

With the Buntingville average air temperature data I computed the mean temperature for each water year. To zero in on the effect of temperature on precip mode and snowpack melting, I calculated the mean temp for the water year using just the eight months of November through June, when most precip and melting is occuring. For lack of a better term, I'll call this the "hydrologically active period of the water year".

.
```{r temp plot, fig.height=4}

p <- plot_ly(tdata, x=~wateryear, y=~avgtemp, color="darkred", type="box") %>%
  layout(title = "Average daily temperature, CIMIS Buntingville station, WY1994 - WY2015",
         xaxis = list(title = "Water year, Nov - Jun only"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Average daily temperature (deg F)"))
p
```
.

Mean annual temperatures varied from 38 to 55 ^o^F. Ideally, we would use just the temperatures during December - June when most of the precip occurs, but for now let's use the entire year.

### Results

Finally, we're ready to plot the date of peak inflow against the mean temperature for the water year. The prediction is that warmer temperatures will, ceti paribus, lead to earlier peak inflows. Here's the scatter plot (ignore the 2017 in the y-axis label):

.
```{r scatter, fig.height=4}
m <- lm(data = fif, julian ~ wy_avgtemp)

a <- as.numeric(as.Date("2017-01-01")) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
b <- as.numeric(as.Date("2017-04-30")) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
l <- plot_ly(fif, x=~wy_avgtemp, y=~doy, text=~year, type="scatter", name="Peak Flow") %>%
     add_trace(fif, x = ~wy_avgtemp, y = as.Date(fitted(m), origin = "2017-01-01"), type = "scatter", mode = "lines",
               line = list(width = 2), dash="dash") %>%
     layout(title = "Oroville, date of peak reservoir inflow vs mean water year temperature",
            xaxis = list(title = 'Mean water year temperature, Nov - June (deg F)'),
            yaxis = list(title = "", range = c(a, b), tick0 = as.numeric(as.Date("2017-01-02"))*24*60*60*1000,
            dtick = 31*24*60*60*1000),
            showlegend = F)
l
```
.

The date of peak inflow for Oroville has varied from Jan 8 to April 28, but most years it occurs sometime in March. In the northern Sierra, peak snowpack occurs in late March on average, and DWR considers April 1 to be the end of major precipitation and the beginning of snowpack melting. A couple years, 1997 and 2013, are outliers. It seems one or two very large storms can have a large effect on the peak timing. Same data with a linear model fit:

.
```{r scatter with trend, fig.height=4}
m <- lm(data = fif, julian ~ wy_avgtemp)
nd <- data.frame(wy_avgtemp = fif$wy_avgtemp)
n <- predict(m, newdata=nd, interval="confidence")
fif$lm <- as.Date(n, origin = "2017-01-01")

a <- as.numeric(as.Date("2017-01-01")) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
b <- as.numeric(as.Date("2017-04-30")) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
l <- plot_ly(fif, x=~wy_avgtemp, y=~doy, text=~year, type="scatter") %>%
     add_trace(fif, x = ~wy_avgtemp, y = ~lm, type = "scatter", mode = "line",
               line = list(width = 1), dash="dash") %>%
     layout(title = "Oroville, date of peak reservoir inflow vs mean water year temperature",
            xaxis = list(title = 'Mean water year temperature, Nov - June (deg F)'),
            yaxis = list(title = "", range = c(a, b), tick0 = as.numeric(as.Date("2017-01-02"))*24*60*60*1000,
            dtick = 31*24*60*60*1000),
            showlegend = F)
l
```
.

**For every 1 degree increase in mean temperature during the hydrologically active part of the water year (Nov--June), the date of peak inflow is 5--11 days earlier (*p = 0.016, R^2^ = 0.22*):**

```{r coefficient table, results=T}
summary(m)
```

The effect size is pretty large but it's only marginally significant, so let's look at another reservoir farther south:

.
```{r Analyze Folsom, fig.height=4}
tempdata <- read_csv("cimis camino.csv", col_types = cols(`CIMIS Region` = col_skip(),
  Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y")))
colnames(tempdata) <- c("id", "name", "date", "julian", "maxtemp", "qc1", "avgtemp", "qc2")
tempdata %<>% select(date, avgtemp) %>% filter(!(month(date) %in% c(7, 8, 9, 10))) %>%
  mutate(avgtemp = ifelse(is.na(avgtemp), 50, avgtemp), wateryear = water_year(date))
tdata <- tempdata
tempdata %<>%group_by(wateryear) %>%
  summarize(wy_avgtemp = mean(avgtemp))

fol <- read_csv("Folsom inflow.csv")
fol %<>% transmute(date = mdy(Date), inflow = as.numeric(Inflow) * 60 *60 * 24 * 7.48 / 325851,
                   year = year(date), julian = yday(date), wateryear = water_year(date)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(inflow), inflow >= 0, wateryear != 1993, wateryear != 2016) %>%
  group_by(wateryear) %>%
  mutate(cumflow = cumsum(inflow), cumdist = cumflow/max(cumflow), cumdiff = abs(cumdist - 0.5)) %>%
  left_join(tempdata, by="wateryear")
fif <- fol %>% filter(cumdiff == min(cumdiff)) %>% mutate(doy = as.Date(julian, origin = "2017-01-01"))

m <- lm(data = fif, julian ~ wy_avgtemp)
nd <- data.frame(wy_avgtemp = fif$wy_avgtemp)
n <- predict(m, newdata=nd, interval="confidence")
fif$lm <- as.Date(n, origin = "2017-01-01")

a <- as.numeric(as.Date("2017-01-01")) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
b <- as.numeric(as.Date("2017-04-30")) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
l <- plot_ly(fif, x=~wy_avgtemp, y=~doy, text=~year, type="scatter") %>%
     layout(title = "Folsom, date of peak reservoir inflow vs mean water year temperature",
            xaxis = list(title = 'Mean water year temperature, Nov - June (deg F)'),
            yaxis = list(title = "", range = c(a, b), tick0 = as.numeric(as.Date("2017-01-02"))*24*60*60*1000,
            dtick = 31*24*60*60*1000),
            showlegend = F)
l
```
.

Folsom is about the same: 1 ^o^F = 4--10 days earlier (*p = 0.017*); temperature data from Camino CIMIS station.

### Discussion
The snowpack serves as an enormous 'free' reservoir for California, storing much more water (5-20 MAF) than we're able to store with artificial reservoirs and releasing it steadily throughout the spring and summer months when demand is highest. This graph shows how the Northern Sierra snowpack builds throughout the winter, reaching a peak in late March. On April 1, DWR measures the depth of the snowpack and estimates how much water will be available through the State Water Project for that year. If the snowpack peaks earlier due to less snow and faster melting In this analysis, we did not consider other factors that may increase the rate of snowmelt, such as dust settling out of the atmosphere onto the snow surface, where it reduces albedo and heats the snow (more of a problem in the Rockies than the Sierra).

### Further analysis
It would be awfully nice if we had a longer historical record to analyze. DWR may have old reservoir data sitting around in some form, and some enterprising analyst could file a public records request, but they probably have more important matters to attend to at the moment. More importantly, the data that is online is difficult to access and time consuming to process; there's no way to just download a raw csv file and the web page must be scraped. The CIMIS weather data, by contrast, is easy to access through their <a href="http://et.water.ca.gov/">API</a>; I even wrote <a href="https://github.com/codeswitching/rcimis" target="_blank">an R tool</a> to do it in a single line of code.

**With all the discussion recently about the need for better water data, one concrete thing agencies like DWR could do is to develop APIs for all of their public-facing databases.** That would allow civic-minded developers, scientists, and open data wonks (and there's a lot of us!) to develop tools and better front-ends for that data. Transit is the key example. By urging cities to standardize their public transit information and expose it through an API, Google was able to provide a much smoother user experience through Google Maps than what the cities had been providing.

In terms of the science, there are other response variables we could analyze. Instead of reservoir inflows, we could look at Sierra streamflows or snowpack SWE (snow water equivalent). But reservoirs are nice because they aggregate multiple effects (rain vs snow dominance, timing of snowmelt) and drain large areas of alpine watershed. We could also look at other predictors such as solar radiation, or at least refine our temperature data to get a more respresentative estimate of temperature than the crude annual mean used here. There may also be a nonlinear response between temperature and runoff that this model doesn't consider. If you have ideas for how to improve this analysis, please let me know.
